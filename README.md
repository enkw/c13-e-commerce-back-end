## Installation
  
If you've cloned/branched this repo, you'll need to npm install, run the schema.sql, npm run seed, and finally run npm start. Once this is done, you'll be able to use software like Insomnia to view and manipulate the data on the database as you need.
  
## Usage
  
Once you've completed the installation instructions, you can make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to api/tags/, api/categories/, and api/products/. For manipulation based on ID, use api/products/:id (products is uses as an example).
