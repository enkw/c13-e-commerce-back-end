## Installation
  
If you've cloned/branched this repo, you'll need to npm install, but otherwise it's not necessary.
  
## Usage
  
To use this application, clone/branch the repo. Open the terminal inside the directory, run "npm install", then you'll need to run npm seed. You should now have the database running and you will be able to manipulate it using software like Insomnia.

I'll also include a link to the repo and a link to a video demo!
